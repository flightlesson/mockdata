Intended to be used to create test data for performance tests of an
SQL database.

The motivation was a 1-billion row table in a PostgreSQL database. The
table was similar to

        CREATE TABLE motivator (
             handle INT NOT NULL
             ,lowest TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
             ,highest TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
             ,stuff TEXT
        );

and had ~10^5 different handle values each with about ~10^4
[lowest,highest] ranges. The ranges were instantaneous up to a few
hours wide in the past couple of years; less than 10% of a handle's
ranges overlapped. Queries were for a specific handle with ranges from
a few minutes to a day or so.

The simplifies to

        CREATE TABLE mock (
            handle INT NOT NULL
            ,lowest INT NOT NULL
            ,highest INT NOT NULL
            ,stuff TEXT
        );

with queries similar to

        SELECT * FROM mock WHERE handle=11242 AND highest >= 800420 AND lowest <= 829006;

My initial PostgreSQL tests started with

      createdb mockdb
      mockdatagenerator --create-table --nrows 100000000 | psql mockdb

My first tests compared index schemes and started like

      alter table mock rename to mock1;
      create table mock2 as select * from table1;
      create index testindex1 on mock1(handle,lowest);
      create index testindex2 on mock2 using gist (handle,(int4range(lowest,highest,'[]')));

It then had many queries/inserts/deletes on both tables to try to
determine which which table -- i.e. index scheme -- was faster. 

Note that in the above test, mock2's index required queries to change:

        SELECT * FROM mock1 WHERE handle=11242 AND highest >= 800420 AND lowest <= 829006;
        SELECT * FROM mock2 WHERE handle=11242 AND int4range(lowest,highest,'[]') && int4range(800420,829006,'[]');
