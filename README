Intended to be used to create test data for performance tests of an SQL database.

The motivation was a 1-billion row table in a PostgreSQL database. The table was similar to 

        CREATE TABLE mock (
            handle INT NOT NULL
            ,lowest INT NOT NULL
            ,highest INT NOT NULL
            ,stuff TEXT
        );

and had ~10^5 different handle values each with ~10^4 [lowest,highest] ranges. The ranges tended to be fairly narrow and,
for each handle, rarely overlapped.

The queries were similar to

        SELECT * FROM mock WHERE handle=11242 AND highest >= 800420 AND lowest <= 829006;

In other words, each SELECT looked for all rows with a specific handle that overlapped a target [highest,lowest] range.

My initial PostgreS!L tests started with

      createdb mockdb
      mockdatagenerator --sql --nrows 100000000 | psql mockdb
